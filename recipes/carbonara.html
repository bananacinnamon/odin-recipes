        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>A classic simple but delicious dish of the Romans; a dish that has often been strayed away from its authenticity with the addition of cream or use of pancetta.
            Follow along to learn how to make an authentic carbonara dish (The ingredients may surprise you!)
        </p>

        <p>This dish may seem easy but it takes a lot of practice to master. A lot of patience (and love) goes a long way!
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 pound guanciale (cured pork cheek), diced</li>
            <li>1 package spaghetti</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>10 tablespoons grated Pecorino Romano</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; add guanciale. Cook, turning occasionally, until evenly browned and crispy, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and drain on paper towels.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 9 minutes. Drain and return to the pot. Let cool, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Whisk eggs, 1/2 of the Pecorino Romano cheese, and some black pepper in a bowl until smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li>Pour egg mixture over pasta, stirring quickly, until creamy and slightly cooled. Stir in guanciale.</li>
            <li>Top with remaining Pecorino Romano cheese and more black pepper.</li>
        </ol>
